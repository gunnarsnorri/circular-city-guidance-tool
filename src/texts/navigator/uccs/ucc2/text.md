# Water and Waste Treatment and Recovery

UCC2 embraces topics and potential issues to be addressed by NBS in the scope of water and wastewater treatment, recovery, and reuse. The treatment of wastewater removes pollutants that can be damaging to the environment and sensitive ecosystems as well as pose health risks to urban dwellers. Instead of conventional practices of collecting all streams of used water in underground pipes and conveying it to a centralized wastewater treatment plant, circularity involves more differentiated management of the various wastewater streams from industry and households. The wastewater streams (i.e., gray, yellow, brown, black) can be reused in a fit-for-purpose approach, in which the quantity and quality of the water that is to be reused should match the quality requirements of the reuse purpose. NBS central to treatment, recovery, and reuse of water include treatment wetlands, rain gardens, or rain-harvesting systems [26,27].
