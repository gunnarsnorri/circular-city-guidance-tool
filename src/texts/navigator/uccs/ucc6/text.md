# Energy Efficiency and Recovery

Reducing the demand for imported (fossil fuel-based) energy is the main challenge from a CE viewpoint related to energy. Energy-efficient buildings, mitigation of the urban heat island effect—and consequently, reducing the demand for cooling in buildings—and heat and energy recovery from different waste streams are foreseen goals that can be achieved with NBS in a circular concept [14].
