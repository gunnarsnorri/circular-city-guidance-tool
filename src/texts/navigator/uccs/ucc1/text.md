# Restoring and Maintaining Water Cycle

UCC1 relates to the water cycle and, more specifically, includes the objective of restoring the natural, pre-development water cycle (mainly by rainwater management). This refers to the behavior of water entering the urban system as precipitation, and the proportions that respectively contribute to evapotranspiration, infiltration, runoff, and other hydrological processes that characterize the water balance. Greening of the urban environment, reducing the proportion of impervious surfaces, rainwater harvesting, and preserving soil and wetlands for water storage all contribute to slowing the passage of water throughout the catchment and help to re-establish a near pre-development water balance. By implementing NBS throughout urban areas, it creates a web of dispersed facilities for onsite stormwater management and runoff control through temporal storage, infiltration, and groundwater recharge. In this context, protection against floods and drought constitutes the central benefits relating to the other challenges [23,24,25]. The NBS that address this challenge include various infiltration options such as retention ponds, green roofs, rain gardens, and floodplains.
