# Street Trees
Street trees are focused on planting, renewing, or maintaining urban street trees. It is designed to be appropriate for its context (right tree in the right place) and to achieve multiple benefits. One single or several trees can be arranged along streets, bicycle paths, and sidewalks. These trees are situated on a single side (e.g., single line trees), and if circumstances allow, they can be established on both sides of the route (e.g., boulevard). In the latter case, the treetops of opposite trees often form a (nearly) closed canopy. Street trees support healthy urban communities through the provision of environmental, social, and economic benefits. They improve citiesâ€™ liveability through the provision of shade, stormwater reduction, improved air quality, and habitat connectivity for urban fauna. Social benefits are represented by the sense of community and safety, and reduced rates of crime. Regarding economic benefits, street trees can reduce energy costs and also increase the business income and property values Adapted
