# Aquaculture
Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans, and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. Aquaculture includes flow-through fish farms as well as recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Aquaculture has potential for providing lower priced fish, enhancing nutritional security and employing poor urban communities. Urban aquaculture can decrease the distance between farm and plate, generate income, use less resources, and serve as a community-building tool. Adapted
