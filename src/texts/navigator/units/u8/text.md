# Bioswale
A Bioswale is a vegetated, linear and low sloped pit, often established in urban areas. It is designed to store and convey surface water runoff and also remove pollutants and sediments. This NBS is often used to drain roads, paths or car parks while enhancing access corridors or other open space (adapted from URBANGREENUP (2018), NATURE4CITIES (2020), UNALAB (2019)).
