# Treatment of Wastewater
The treatment service refers to the removal of contaminants from wastewater or greywater (wastewater without the toilet).
At household level, on-site wastewater treatment is feasible through NBS units like treatment wetlands, green roofs and vertical greening systems. 
On a bigger scale, treatment wetlands have been effectively applied for wastewater treatment for small settlements  as well as communities of 20,000 persons (Orhei, Moldova). 
Due to their passive operation, NBS only consume a fractionof the energy of conventional technical systems, such as sequencing batch reactors and activated sludge plants, and therefore contribute to a more sustainable water treatment system. 
A disinfection stage is necessary depending on the reuse purposes.
Using NBS for wastewater treatment can provide habitats for many species, thereby contributing to biodiversity.
