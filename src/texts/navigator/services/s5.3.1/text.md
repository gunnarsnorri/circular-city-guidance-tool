# Biomass Recovery
A wide range of bio-based products can be processed and valorised from recovered biomass. These include agricultural or gardening inputs such as compost, mulch, biochar, as well as bioenergy (biomethane, biofuels), essential chemical building blocks such as volatile fatty acids, and materials, such as biopolymers. These products can largely be obtained through bio-based industrial processes such as anaerobic digestion or microalgae treatment. Lignocellulosic material can be pyrolyzed to biochar. The production of lipids from bio-based residues and wastewater has gained momentum as it is a building block for various industrial applications in polymers, lubricants, coatings, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, surfactants, solvents, plastics, and fuels, among others. As such, they can replace petroleum, which is a conventional resource for these products.
