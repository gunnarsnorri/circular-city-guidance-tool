# Collection / Separation of Wastewater
The collection of household wastewater can either be done by a single piping system, collecting all the wastewater, or by a separated system generating two resources, namely blackwater and greywater. By applying source separation, valuable resources can be recovered more precisely for reuse purposes.  
The collection service is performed by the sewerage pipe conveying wastewater to a collection vault for the separation of solid and liquid fractions of wastewater for further on-site treatment.
In general, wastewater not only provides water for reuse purposes but also nutrient recovery as well as energy contained in biomass and water temperatures from showers, washing machine and dishwasher .
