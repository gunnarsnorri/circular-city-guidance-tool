# Collection / Conveyance
The service “Collection and conveyance” of rainwater describes how and where rainwater can be collected and transported towards reuse purposes. 

 This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as rooftop collection, collection from other impervious surfaces like parking lots or sidewalks, or collection from open areas. The collected water is then directed into a conveyance system.  This can be either a piped system within or outside of a building for rooftop collection or the transport in drainage pipes or open channels for surface collection. 

 This may involve the use of gravity to move water through pipes or channels, or the use of pumps to move water uphill or over long distances. There are some limitations associated with rainwater collection and conveyance systems, which must be carefully considered and addressed to ensure that the systems are safe and effective:  

>Quantity: The amount of rainwater that can be collected and reused is limited by a variety of factors, such as the size of the collection area, the frequency and intensity of rainfall, and the storage capacity of the system. 

>Maintenance: Rainwater collection and conveyance systems require regular maintenance to ensure that they continue to function effectively and safely. Maintenance may involve cleaning collection areas and storage tanks, inspecting pipes and valves for leaks or damage, and testing water quality. 

>Regulations: The use of rainwater collection and conveyance systems may be subject to regulations and permits, which can be complex and vary depending on local and regional laws.
