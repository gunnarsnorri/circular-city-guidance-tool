# Production of Edible Biomass
Placing food production in the city offers potential to improve food security, through providing access to high-quality food in food deserts, as well as the sustainability of the urban food systems. Food production in a circular economy minimizes or eliminates waste, emulating natural processes in ecosystems where waste is transformed into resources that feed other processes. Urban food production requires nutrient, water and energy supply. For these inputs to be provided sustainably, and the environmental, social and economic benefits to be realised, the integration of urban farming considerations must form part of urban planning processes. Irrigation water, fertiliser and carbon-rich substrates can be recovered from urban waste and wastewater using nature-based solutions.  Sources of these secondary resources include, e.g., domestic wastewater, urine, feces, greywater as well wastewaters from food production, e.g., milk, tea, coffee, brewery, as well as nutrient-rich solid waste streams, e.g., composting, biogas, biochar.
