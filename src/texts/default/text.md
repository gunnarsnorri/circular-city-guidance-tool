# Circularity with NBS
# a guidance support system

## Welcome Circular City traveller!

This guidance tool relies on 5 levels of information (coloured circles). The inner one (**yellow**) represents five different urban circularity challenges:
-	Restoring and maintaining the water cycle
-	Water and waste treatment and recovery
-	Nutrient recovery and reuse
-	Energy efficiency and recovery
-	Food and biomass production

In order to specifically adress a certain urban circularity challenge demands for the implementation are used (**red**)
On the next level (**blue**) a series of services were identified that are needed to address a given demand, and that will be provided by different nature-based solutions units (**green**).
The guidance tool was designed so that a user can start at any point, on a demand, on a service, or in an NBS and will show the interconnections.

This tool, and the framework behind it, is the result of a long and iterative process caried out by the [COST Action Circular Cities](www.circular-city.eu)
