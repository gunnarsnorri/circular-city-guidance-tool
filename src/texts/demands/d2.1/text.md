# Alt. Water Source Wastewater
Urban wastewater comes from sources such as households, commercial buildings or industrial processes. Household wastewater originates from toilets (blackwater) and all other water uses from bathrooms and kitchen sinks as well as washing machines and dishwashers (greywater). Due to the daily production (100 - 200 litres per person and day), wastewater is a very valuable and reliable source for reuse purposes. State-of-the-art treatment technologies can ensure safe treatment for reuse purposes, including irrigation, toilet flushing, cooling and other non-potable water reuses. 
Especially greywater has become a well investigated resource as the overall pollution is rather low and therefore on-site treatment and reuse have a high potential for circularity.  
Safe reuse is provided by available water reuse guidelines and standards worldwide. In the European Union, water reuse is governed by the [EU Wastewater Reuse Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020R0741). Furthermore,  Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, France and Portugal have their own laws and regulations for reclaimed water for irrigation, predating the EU Regulation and partly allowing for other reuse purposes in addition to irrigation.
