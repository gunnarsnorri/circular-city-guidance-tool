# Alt. Water Source Rainwater
Rainwater is a valuable resource for local reuse including irrigation, washing cars, toilet flushing and laundry. Rainwater harvesting can thereby reduce the freshwater needs, for uses that do not demand the high-quality standards of drinking water. Intercepting and harvesting the water from precipitation before it forms runoff in the urban catchment not only presents an additional, low-cost water source, but also contributes to re-establishing the pre-development water cycle. Main issues lie within the actual occurrence of precipitation especially when water is needed the most during long dry periods. Therefore, additional sources of may be needed to cover the needed demand
