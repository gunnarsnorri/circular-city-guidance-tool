# Alt. Water Source Rainwater
Rainwater is a valuable resource for local reuse, e.g., irrigation of green areas, washing cars, toilet flushing and laundry. Rainwater harvesting can
thereby reduce the freshwater needs, for uses that do not demand the high-quality standards of drinking water. Intercepting and harvesting the water from
precipitation before it forms runoff [precipitation running over the landscape, which can in extreme cases lead to flooding and potentially incorporating
pollutants] in the urban catchment not only presents an additional, low-cost water source, but also contributes to re-establishing the pre-development
water cycle. 
Main issues lie within the time period of precipitation and the time period when water is needed, typically the most during long dry periods.
Therefore, additional sources of water may be needed to cover the demand for alternative water sources.
