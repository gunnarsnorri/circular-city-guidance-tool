# Sustainable Rainwater Management
Built-up, urban environments are characterised by a drastically altered water balance, compared to that of undeveloped, natural landscapes. Sealed-off and hydraulically smooth surfaces combined with little to no vegetation result in higher runoff volumes and peaks, along with significantly lower proportions of infiltration and evaporation. Climate change is expected to exacerbate this disturbed water balance. The change in precipitation patterns puts a tremendous pressure on the existing sewer system and causes urban flooding. 

 By implementing NBS throughout the city, it is possible to begin re-establishing a more natural water balance, reducing runoff peaks and volumes and promoting infiltration, retention and evapotranspiration. Groundwater recharge is an important factor in securing the drinking water supply of many cities. Urban greening interventions can contribute to groundwater recharge by facilitating infiltration processes and land restoration can increase the water holding capacity of natural land upstream of urban areas.
