# Food and Biomass Production
Food and biomass production can significantly contribute to closing of material cycling, thus maximizing the reuse of resources in the urban environment itself while reducing the need for external resource inputs.
Circularity in agricultural production follows three principles: 
1. “plant biomass is the basic building block of food and should be used by humans first”; 
2. “by-products from food production, processing, and consumption should be recycled back into the food system”; 
3. “use animals for what they are good at”, i.e., from “low-opportunity-cost feeds” to valuable outputs and products.

Nature-based solutions for food and biomass production contribute to address at least one urban circularity challenge. Certain nature-based solutions for food and biomass production can be circular in themselves, while others need nearby nature-based solutions or are strategically located to address other urban circularity challenges.
