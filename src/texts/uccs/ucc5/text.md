# Food and Biomass Production

This Urban Circularity Challenge relates to the crucial matter of sustainable food and biomass production in cities as well as biomaterial recovery from NBS. Since there is no food production without water, the many intersections between urban water and urban agriculture are clear as well as the intrinsic link between UCC5 and water-related UCC1,2. For example, NBS such as hydroponic systems are generally more efficient than traditional soil-based systems in terms of water use and can be as productive as the latter. In addition, various types of water sources (from tap water to wastewater) can be collected and recirculated within the hydroponic system. Noteworthy NBS used in urban agriculture are ground-based and rooftop gardens, edible walls, hydroponic food production (indoor and outdoor), as well as urban orchards, honey production, and aquaculture. However, NBS with different purposes (beyond food production) can interact in order to address UCC5 and other linked UCC1,2,3. For example, treatment wetlands (TWs) used for water pollution control can contribute to a community garden through the provision of treated wastewater for irrigation and the production of compost or peat, which can be used for conditioning soils, boosting soil fertility, increasing water storage capacity, and improving productivity [30].
