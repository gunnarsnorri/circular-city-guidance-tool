# Nutrient Recovery and Reuse

This UCC focuses on the recovery and reuse of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which are valuable resources that enter household wastewater through human excreta. Removal of these components from wastewater not only ensures a safer reintroduction into the natural environment, but these components also serve as a resource in fertilizer production, which can be utilized in urban agriculture or landscaping. The separation of different substance streams is an efficient way to recover nutrients such as N and P, but this practice requires substantial changes in the way we manage human waste. Substantial changes to infrastructure at both household and city level are needed for the source separation approach. Nutrients recovered from wastewater streams and source separation can be used in gardening and food production as a circular alternative to artificial fertilizers. Struvite fertilizer is an example of nutrient recovery for food production [28,29]. Using the nutrients from wastewater is not a new concept, but the systematic implementation of such practices and adjusting city planning accordingly is. The NBS central to nutrient recovery and reuse include treatment wetlands, waste stabilization ponds, composting, bioremediation, and phytoremediation.
