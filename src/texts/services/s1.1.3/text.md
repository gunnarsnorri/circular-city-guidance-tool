# Storage of Rainwater
The service “Storage of rainwater” describes the needed volume based on the available rainwater and its temporal occurrence. 

While rainwater storage systems have numerous benefits, there are also some limitations and challenges that need to be considered in the design and implementation of these systems: 

> **Limited storage capacity**: One of the primary limitations of rainwater storage systems is their limited storage capacity. Depending on the size of the storage tank or container, it may not be possible to capture and store all of the rainwater that falls on a given property or area. This means that some rainwater may still run off into stormwater drains or other areas, reducing the efficiency of the system. 

>**Weather-dependent**: Rainwater storage systems rely on rainfall to provide a source of water. If there is a drought or prolonged period of low rainfall, the system may not be able to capture enough water to meet demand. This can limit the reliability of the system and make it less useful in areas with unpredictable weather patterns. 

>**Space requirements**: Some rainwater storage system (e.g., cisterns) require significant amounts of space for installation. This may be challenging in dense urban areas where space is limited, and it may not be feasible for some property owners or communities. 

>**Maintenance requirements**: Rainwater storage systems require regular maintenance to ensure that they function effectively and safely. For example, tanks or containers need to be cleaned periodically to prevent the buildup of debris and algae. 

Overall, while rainwater storage systems offer many benefits for circular cities, it is important to carefully consider these limitations and develop systems that are well-suited to the local conditions and needs of the community.
