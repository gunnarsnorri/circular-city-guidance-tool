# Revalorization
The revalorisation service provides processes to extract and recover nutrients from wastewater, in various degrees of purity and concentrations. To avoid losses, in particular of nitrogen, processes in absence of oxygen are preferred. This can be achieved by NBS as well as dedicated Supporting units. Depending on the final application, the streams to be recovered can require different levels of treatment, e.g., food crops would require sanitisation before the application.
The technologies can be applied at different scales, ranging from servicing a single household up to an apartment house or city scale. Potentially, recovery would yield a yearly average of 5 kg of nitrogen and 0.8 kg of phosphorus per person, capable to fertilise ca. 180 m2 of productive crops.
