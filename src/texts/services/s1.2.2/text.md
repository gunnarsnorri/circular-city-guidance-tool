# Infiltration
The service “Rainwater infiltration” is an important component of sustainable rainwater management, particularly in areas with well-drained soils or porous surfaces. Infiltration refers to the process by which rainwater is absorbed into the ground, where it can be stored or used to recharge groundwater aquifers. Here are some of the key roles of rainwater infiltration in sustainable rainwater management:
1)	Recharge groundwater: Infiltration allows rainwater to slowly percolate into the ground, which can help to recharge groundwater aquifers. This is important for maintaining healthy ecosystems and providing a sustainable source of water for human use.
2)	Reduce runoff and erosion: By infiltrating into the ground, rainwater can help to reduce the volume and velocity of runoff, which can reduce erosion and sedimentation in local waterways. This is particularly important in areas with steep slopes or unstable soils, where erosion can be a major problem.
3)	Improve water quality: Infiltration can help to improve the quality of stormwater runoff by allowing pollutants to be filtered or treated by the soil.
There are several limitations that must be considered when designing and implementing infiltration systems: 
1)	Soil properties: Infiltration rates depend heavily on soil properties, such as texture, structure, and permeability. Soils with high clay content or compacted soils may not be suitable for infiltration because they have low permeability and may become saturated quickly, which can cause runoff and erosion.
2)	Contamination: Rainwater can pick up contaminants, such as heavy metals, pathogens, and chemicals, from impervious surfaces or other sources. If infiltration systems are not properly designed or maintained, these contaminants can be carried into the soil and groundwater, potentially posing a risk to human health and the environment.
3)	Maintenance: Infiltration systems require regular maintenance to ensure that they function properly and do not become clogged or degraded over time. 
4)	Site constraints: Infiltration systems require sufficient space and suitable conditions to function effectively. Sites with steep slopes, shallow bedrock, or high-water tables may not be suitable for infiltration, as water may not be able to infiltrate into the soil.
