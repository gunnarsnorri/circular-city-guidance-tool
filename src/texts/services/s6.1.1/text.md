# Microclimate Regulation
Microclimate is the complex of environmental variables, including temperature, radiation, humidity and wind, that forms near the surface of the Earth. It differs from the weather forecastersâ€™ macroclimate or local climate because of the influence of the Earth surface and, most importantly, due to the presence of vegetation. Trees and plant foliage, in facts, can act as windbreaks andcanopies, altering the local air flows dynamic, and the mulch resulting from the tree litter can provide shade and thermoregulation (temperature regulation). Nature Based Solutions can be applied within this context, in order to explit their natural dynamics to reduce the urban heat island (UHI)
