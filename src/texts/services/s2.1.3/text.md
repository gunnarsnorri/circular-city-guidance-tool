# Storage of Wastewater
Storage is a service that supports the availability of treated wastewater when it is needed for reuse purposes. The treated water can be stored on the ground or below ground using vault and tanks. The size depends on the water demand expected over time.
The storage system does not need any active aeration but may require a ventilation system to release produced gases. It must also be accessible for maintenance works
