# Energy Recovery From Biomass
Urban green areas require regular maintenance, and green cuttings are consequentially collected with regularity, giving a waste with a high potential for being reused in biogas production or thermal energy utilization. 
According to the German Federal Highway Institute, biogas yield from grass cuttings is in the range of 150-200 m³/t (amount of Methane ~ 55%) with an energetic value of about 3 MJ/kg (energetic value of Methane ~ 9.97kWh/m³). For woody plants, which can be used to produce biogenic solid fuels, the calorific value of dry biomass is in the range of 16.5-19MJ/kg.
Possible challenges can be posed by impurities and contaminants potentially present in the materials, that can impact on the energetic value and safety of use. Preliminary analyses are therefore fundamental to assess the suitability of the biowaste for energy conversion. In addition, the costs for maintenance, transportation, disposal of slag, ashes, and digestates, which depend on the raw material and its heterogeneity, need to be considered.
