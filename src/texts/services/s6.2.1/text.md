# Increase energy sufficiency in buildings
NBS units can be installed on building surfacesto decrease its operating energy consumption and therefore contribute to energy efficiency: through shading, transpiration, insulation, and by changing air flow patterns, specific units can cool the building down in summer and prevent heat losses during winter. For the cooling period, many examples in both monitoring and modelling these effects can be found, wehreas, for the heating period, less case studies and, thus, data areavailable yet.It must be considered that the thermal effects of NBS can change strongly between seasons, due to varying metabolic activity of the living organisms and as deciduous plants shed their leaves in the heating season, leading to stronger solar heat gains.In addition, design, planning, construction, and maintenance influence the system performance. Therefore, expert knowledge and proper management are fundamental to fully exploit the potential of the applied solutions and to avoid adverse effects, such as the formation of thermal bridges. Regarding insulating effects of Vertical Greenery Systems, [Tudiwer et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.11.023) demonstrated that, for an administrative building (MA48) and a school building (Kandlgasse 39) both located in Vienna, a pot-based green façade increased the walls thermal resistance by 0.31-0.35 m²K/W and 0.67-0.68 m²K/W, respectively.
