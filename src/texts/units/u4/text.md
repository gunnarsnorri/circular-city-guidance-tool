# Filter drain
Filter drains are shallow trenches filled with stone/gravel that create temporary subsurface storage for attenuation, conveyance and filtration of surface water runoff. The stone may be contained in a simple trench lined with a geotextile, geomembrane or other impermeable liner, or with a more structural facility such as a concrete trough. Adapted from Ballard et al. (2015).
