# Productive Garden
Productive gardens are areas of land dedicated to the cultivation of vegetables, fruits (fruit trees), (flowers), and small livestock (chicken) for the main purpose of food production (whose output has a significant share of food production). These gardens can be differently owned, yet ownership has no effect in terms of the function of the NBS unit.
