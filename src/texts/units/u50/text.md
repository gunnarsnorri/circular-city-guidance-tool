# Urban farms and orchards
Urban farms and orchards are agriculture ventures dedicated to food production in a city; they are often professionally run and considerably larger than gardens. Food production may include big livestock (cows), fruits (fruit trees), and main food crops (maize, wheat). Larger urban farms also participate in community programmes such as skills development and job training that can benefit underserved populations. Furthermore, as a form of green infrastructure, urban farms and community gardens can help reduce urban heat island effects, mitigate the impacts of urban stormwater, and lower the energy embodied in food transportation.
