# Bioretention cell (Rain garden)
A bioretention cell is a shallow depressed vegetated area that primarily serves as area for water control (storage and infiltration) on a small-scale especially in urban areas. It is designed to collect, store, filter and treat water runoff. Storm water runoff is drained, stored for a certain period, and then it infiltrates either into the ground soil or flows into the sewage system. To optimise its functions, it must include a porous soil mixture, native vegetation and some hyper accumulator plants, capable of phyto-remediation. Adapted from URBANGREENUP (2018), UNALAB (2019).
