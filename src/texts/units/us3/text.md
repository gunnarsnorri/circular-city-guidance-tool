# Phosphate precipitation (for P recovery)
Phosphate precipitation refers to the chemical precipitation of phosphorus. It is brought about by the addition of the salts of multivalent metal ions that form precipitates of sparingly soluble phosphates. The multivalent metal ions used most commonly are calcium, aluminum, and iron. For struvite precipitation, magnesium is added. Struvite precipitation is controlled by a combination of physicochemical factors including temperature, mixing energy, pH, the degree of Mg, NH4, and PO4 supersaturation, and the presence of competing ions. Magnesium generally needs to be added. Adapted
