# Photo Bio Reactor
A Photo Bio Reactor (PBR) is defined as a closed (or mostly closed) vessel for phototrophic production in which the energy is supplied via electric lights. A PBR design should use light efficiently with uniform illumination, reduce shading, provide a fast mass
transfer of CO2 and O2, and attain high biomass growth. Adapted
