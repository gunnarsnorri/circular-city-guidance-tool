# Extensive green roof
An extensive green roof implies basic, light-weight, planted systems that are implemented on the rooftop of a building. The most common plants used are sedum, herbs, mosses, and grasses. The installation and maintenance are less expensive than that of intensive systems. The substrate is relatively thinner (10â€“15 cm, or reduced form >10 cm) than for intensive systems (more than 20 cm)
