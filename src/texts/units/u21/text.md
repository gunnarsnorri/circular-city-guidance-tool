# Treatment Wetland
Treatment wetlands (TWs) include a range of engineered systems designed and constructed to replicate natural processes occurring in natural wetlands involving vegetation, soils, and the associated microbial assemblages to assist in treating wastewater streams (e.g. domestic wastewater, greywater, industrial wastewater) and stormwater. TWs can be divided in two main hydrological categories: Free water surface wetlands, a shallow sealed basin or sequence of basins (open water areas) containing floating plants, submerged plants or emergent plants (similar in appearance to natural marshes); Subsurface flow wetlands, which include Horizontal flow (HF) wetlands and Vertical flow (VF) wetlands. In this case, the water flows beneath the surface level, either horizontally or vertically, through the filter bed.
