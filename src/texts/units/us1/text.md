# Rain Water Harvesting
Rainwater harvesting (RWH) in cities consists of the concentration, collection, storage, and treatment of rainwater from rooftops, terraces, courtyards, and other impervious surfaces for on-site use, with the aim of reducing drinking water consumption from centrally supplied sources. Rainwater harvesting reduces runoff volume and peak flows. Rainwater can be collected in cisterns, bladder tanks, and precast ferrocement septic tanks. Adapted
